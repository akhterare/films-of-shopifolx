This web app was created with 💚    for the **Fall 2021 Shopify Frontend Developer Internship Challenge**, using React and Styled Components, with Figma for the design process. It uses an intuitive, visually appealing UI to enable entrepreneurial Shopifolx to browse and share their nominations for the 2021 Shoppies.
 

## Highlights ✨
* **Using React + Figma To Build A Design System**: I hadn't created a design system from scratch and implemented it end-to-end before, so I was proud to see how much creating a defined design system beforehand sped up development. I created the components using Figma's "Inspect" tool to apply Styled Component "styles" to each component, creating a very modular app.
* **Building a Beautiful UX**: Because I was creating for "cinephiles" who were also entrepeneurs, I spent a lot of time focusing on the inuitive, seamless feel of the simple functions of nominating/removing films — that's why I removed the "nominate" button, replacing it with the entire film's poster, which felt more visual and impactful (and Netflix-esque!)


## Technology 💻
* **React (JavaScript)** - used by Shopify frontend developers and in industry, allowed me to practice composition and limit low-level business logic as much as I could (although I didn't cover everything)
* **Styled Components (CSS)** - enabled me to build global styles and implement components based on my design system in Figma 

## Design Process 
* I brainstormed, sketched, and designed the entire application using Google Docs, my iPad, and Figma, which I [documented here](https://www.figma.com/file/5A1bX3xQZ2V1nWHJaLfiBH/Films-of-Shopifolx?node-id=76%3A98)
